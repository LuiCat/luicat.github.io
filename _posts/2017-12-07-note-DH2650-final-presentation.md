### Notes on Other Teams

As I have to leave the presentation session early for my lab class, here is the notes on games I had watched:

#### KamiClones - The platform puzzle game that can be passed on character's dead bodies

- Great to see there is multiple types of character to die for different usages. So I see the puzzle is the challenge itself, but the demo seems not challenging enough?

- The game seems to be slow paced in my point of view, so I'm not quite interested in this game.

- The final game didn't inplemented the art styles.

- The gravity seems to be of low gravity, the charactor seems to be floaty in the air, as well as when bounced from bouncers dropped by "bouncy characters" the character went pretty high.

- WTF the ceiling has invisible spike walls.

- The price (10EU) is too expensive for me, even if changes other than the game contents design would be made.

- Overall I think it could be better if the art styles and good story lines, as well challenges are implemented into the game. (But I will not buy the game :P)

#### Arrrr - The real-life model(figure) based AR chess game

- Vuforia SDK. Is that a network library? Wow.

- Buy models online and ship it to me? Great! (But no figures use in the demo version, what a pity.)

- The demo: Art style seems already there. Looks OK. Large + small ships combination.

- Not impressed, so probably not able to remember this late after the presentation. Too bad :(

#### B.A.M. - The battle arena game manager game

- Pixel arts. Every character is semi-naked.

- Team. The only AI: defence target position for teams. Looks stupid in aspect of real player strategies.

### Notes on Our Game

Finally it's the turn for TIMELAPSE!

The level is still too hard for all classmates, even for my teammates, but pretty basic for myself. So maybe still lack more efforts on the difficulty control.

Bj√∂rn commented that the game fulfilled our quality target.

And here's the video of the live show!

So bad that the damage of the player seems to be double, due to a critical bug allowing the player to attack off-beat (although the damage multiplier will be reset).

### Summary

It's a pity that I cannot go through the whole presentation session (because of my presentation in another lab class), so there is few games I'm interested in that I'm not possible to watch their final show off. Also, I was too concentrated on the game development, so it would be a great effort for me to update all things about the game design and the course after this day.

Best team ever!
