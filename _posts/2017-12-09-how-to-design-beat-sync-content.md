Working in progress...

## In the Beginning

As I finished my Computer Game Design course, the development of the game TIMELAPSE had come to an end. Surprisingly the level design didn't become a pain for me, and I think this is because my previous experiences on designing beat-synchronized game contents when making DanmakuLyrica.

### About TIMELAPSE

TIMELAPSE is game project in my Computer Game Design course in KTH. The game is developed to satisfy our quality target, so that moderate 3D models and animations is implemented into the game, but only one level is made to show our game mechanics.

I participated in the core mechanics programming such as beat-synchronization scripts and the level design. The rhythm part of the game mechanics also originated from some of my previous ideas, and is processed and polished together with other ideas from the team to become our final design of the game.

The gameplay is recorded here:

### About DanmakuLyrica

DanmakuLyrica is my graduation design for my bachelor's degree. It consists of a simple game engine fully designed and developed by myself that can be used to realize beat-synchronized games contents, and a rhythm shooting game level.

I have the gameplay recorded here: (sorry for the shattered graphics, there're so many moving objects so not well presented at the bitrate Youtube gave)

As in the video, the game is designed as a score-hunting game, so that being hit by bullets is painless if no high scores is required, so to guarantee the player to experience through the whole game level (as well the music). The boss is on the screen from the beginning, and have several phrases with patterns reflecting to the music.

## Beat Synchronizing

OK, here we comes into a question: What is the difference in designs between a normal level and beat-synchronized level? Some obvious answer can be instantly spoken out: Timing. Actually the term "timing" is confused with multiple levels of meanings, so it's not really accurate and may do harm to the actual designs.

For me, I understood beat-synchronizing as two different sides: 1. The reflecion to the music; 2. The hitfeel of beats.

### Reflection to the Music

In different aspects, reflection to the music can be done in two levels, one is the macro level and the other is the micro level. The two level cooperates together and are inseparable when making the whole level design.

#### Macro Level

In macro level, the task of content design is to show reflection to changes in the music regarding to sections/chapters. Usually a popular music consists of several sections, such like intro, verse, chorus, interlude and outro. During each section the style of rhythm stays mostly the same and between section there is changes making contrast. The principle of showing reflection to these characteristic of the music is, to design unique contents regarding to different sections, while keeping the consistency of other parts of the contents.

Take the boss stage of TIMELAPSE as an example. Through out the whole boss stage, charms is used for the main mechanics of the boss. The charm itself is just a part of consistency of **normal** game designs. The special point about charms and as well bullets is, I used charms mainly to reflect to the rhythm, but used bullets to reflect to the beats. One special point of the design that worth mentioning is the timing for cross-shooting charms to start shooting, as shown in the video:

Taking notes on the music would be helpful for later work, and even simple notes on the sections helps enough a lot. I wrote some notes while listening to the music before starting to design the level, copied below:

```
Section   Beats
Intro A   16  -- introduce boss
Intro B   16  -- simple pattern, no shoot
Main A    32  -- enemy shoots
Sub A     32  -- boss shoots, enemy no shoot
Between   32  -- puzzle with enemies. give chance for massive damage
Outro     32  -- game should finish. repeated pattern
```

#### Micro Level

The micro level part is more interesting.
