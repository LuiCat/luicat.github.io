Note: 

- Chaser324's wireframe shaders won't work in WebGL version, so I replaced them with cull-disabled unlit shaders.
- The direction of view would randomly shifts if you scroll while moving the mouse; use Q and E keys instead if this problem exists. Seems to be issue with the browser, as it doesn't exist in Windows version.
- Also, full screen for better experience.
